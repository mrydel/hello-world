# hello-world
This is the first repository I have ever created on GitHub

This is the first edit I have ever made and I feel optimistic about it.
I come from the background of English-Polish-English interpreting, yet somehow I made it into software dev :)
The world is a very interesting place and I seek to learn as many of its secrets as it is humanely possible
